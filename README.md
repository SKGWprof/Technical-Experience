# Technical-Experience
Two folders. One contains Problem Sets solved by me from the CS50x course offered by Harvard. The other is a list of over 50 code snippets, some extending to over 800 lines of code, used in my two websites, written in php, css, javascript, and some embedding html. Please read the README for more details.
