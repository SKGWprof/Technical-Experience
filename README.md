# Technical-Experience
Two folders. One contains Problem Sets solved by me from the CS50x course offered by Harvard. The other is a list of code snippets chosen from over 50, some extending to over 800 lines of code, used in my two websites, written in php, css, javascript, and some embedding html. The links to the websites are justashop.shop and theaiaproject.com, the latter is an online store, the former is a website I built for my school community to foster undertaking projects.
# Use-of-AI
I used AI when making the code snippets, however I also used my own skills to debug the code when necessary.
